rrb tree
a tree structure suitable for implementing a vector
sketch in figure 2 of rrbvector.pdf
catenable: can concatenate two vectors, one with keys 0-n another with keys 0-m to a single vector with keys 0-m+n where n-m+n come from the second one's 0-m

hash array mapped trie
a prefix-tree (trie) structure suitable for implementing an associative array
can combine two associative arrays, where each key-value from each is part of the new associative array

persistent b-tree

terminology
associative array, dictionary, map, table: key-value store
vector: key-value store but with non-negative integer keys
